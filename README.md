## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

Follow these simple steps to get the Weather Reporter up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Get your API Key

To fetch weather data, you'll need a free API key from WeatherAPI.com:

1.  Go to [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
2.  Sign up for a free account.
3.  Once registered, navigate to your dashboard to find your API key.

### 2. Configure the API Key

Open the `script.js` file in your project and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained from WeatherAPI.com:

```javascript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your WeatherAPI.com API key
```

### 3. Run the Application

There are two easy ways to run the application:

#### Option 1: Open `index.html` Directly

Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your project folder, or drag and drop it into your web browser. The application will open immediately.

#### Option 2: Use a Local Development Server (Recommended for full functionality)

For a more robust local development experience, especially if you encounter any browser security restrictions (e.g., related to fetching data locally), you can use a simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in server:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
3.  Install `http-server` globally (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
4.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    http-server
    ```
5.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the address shown in your terminal).

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.
